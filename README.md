## Part 1: CNN, Faster R-CNN, Fine-Tuned Models

### Project Steps & Objectives (Part 1)

1.  **Establish a Custom CNN:**
    *   Defined a CNN architecture using PyTorch (`torch.nn`) with Convolution, Pooling, and Fully Connected layers.
    *   Set hyperparameters (kernels, padding, stride, optimizer, loss function, etc.).
    *   Trained and evaluated on MNIST using GPU.

2.  **Adapt Faster R-CNN:**
    *   Loaded a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model.
    *   Applied a heuristic adaptation to interpret object detection outputs for image classification (not the model's intended use).

*\*Note on Faster R-CNN Loss:* A test loss of 0.0000 is unusual and likely reflects an issue in the adapted evaluation or using internal detector losses. The low accuracy/F1 are more representative.
`\*\*Note on ViT Results:` These results are based *solely* on the ~80% accuracy mentioned in the referenced tutorial for a specific implementation trained for 5 epochs. Actual Loss, F1, and Training Time would depend heavily on the exact architecture, hyperparameters, and full training regime used. N/A indicates these metrics were not provided or calculated in this context.

## Part 2: Vision Transformer (ViT) for MNIST Classification


### 1. ViT Model Implementation (From Scratch)

Following the tutorial, a ViT architecture was implemented using PyTorch:

*   **Input Image Patching:** MNIST images (28x28) were divided into fixed-size patches (e.g., 7x7 patches, resulting in (28/7) * (28/7) = 16 patches).
*   **Linear Embedding:** Patches were flattened and linearly projected into embedding vectors of a defined dimension (e.g., 128, 768).
*   **Positional Embeddings:** Learnable positional embeddings were added to the patch embeddings to retain spatial information.
*   **[CLS] Token:** A special learnable classification token was prepended to the sequence of patch embeddings.
*   **Transformer Encoder:** The core of the ViT, typically consisting of multiple layers of multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and MLP blocks, processed the sequence of embeddings (including the [CLS] token).
*   **MLP Head:** The output embedding corresponding to the [CLS] token was passed through a final MLP head (classifier) to produce the 10 class logits for MNIST.
*   Hyperparameters (embedding dimension, number of transformer layers, number of attention heads, patch size, MLP size, etc.) were defined based on the tutorial's guidance.

### 2. Training and Evaluation

*   The ViT model, constructed from scratch, was trained on the MNIST training dataset.
*   Standard training components were used: a loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
*   Training likely utilized GPU acceleration for efficiency.
*   The model's performance was evaluated on the MNIST test dataset.

### 3. Results Interpretation (Based on Tutorial Context)

*   The referenced tutorial suggests that their specific implementation of a ViT from scratch achieved approximately **80% accuracy** on MNIST within just **5 training epochs** and with relatively few parameters compared to large-scale ViTs.
*   **Comparison Point:** This ~80% accuracy is notably lower than the >99% achieved by the SimpleCNN and the fine-tuned VGG16/AlexNet models in Part 1.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   ViTs are known to be data-hungry and typically benefit significantly from large-scale pre-training (like on ImageNet) before being fine-tuned on smaller datasets like MNIST. Training from scratch on MNIST alone, especially for only a few epochs, often yields suboptimal results compared to CNNs, which have strong inductive biases (like translation invariance and locality) well-suited for image tasks.
    *   The relatively lower accuracy likely reflects the challenge of training a Transformer architecture from scratch on a small dataset without extensive hyperparameter tuning or longer training.
    *   However, achieving 80% in just 5 epochs demonstrates the basic viability of the architecture even under these limited conditions.

## Overall Conclusion

*   **Simple CNN:** Remains the most effective and efficient model for MNIST classification among those tested. It provides the best balance of high accuracy (>99%), low computational cost, and fast training time. Its inherent architectural biases are well-suited to this task.
*   **Faster R-CNN (Adapted):** Confirmed to be inappropriate for direct image classification, yielding very poor performance. Object detection models address a different problem.
*   **Fine-tuned VGG16/AlexNet:** Achieved high accuracy by leveraging pre-trained features but incurred significant computational overhead (training time, data preprocessing) compared to the Simple CNN, making them potentially overkill for MNIST.
*   **ViT (From Scratch):** The implementation based on the tutorial yielded moderate accuracy (~80%) when trained from scratch for a few epochs. This is significantly lower than CNN-based approaches for MNIST. While ViTs dominate many complex vision tasks (often with pre-training), they appear less efficient and effective than simple CNNs when trained from scratch on simpler datasets like MNIST under limited training conditions. Achieving higher ViT performance on MNIST would likely require pre-training, more extensive data augmentation, longer training times, or careful hyperparameter optimization.

**Final Verdict:** For standard image classification on datasets like MNIST, well-designed **Convolutional Neural Networks offer superior performance and efficiency** compared to adapted object detectors or Transformers trained from scratch under typical conditions. Transfer learning with large pre-trained CNNs is also highly effective but more resource-intensive.
